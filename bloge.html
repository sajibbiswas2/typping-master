                    1. Local Storage Vs. Session Storage defaricne?
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

                     <br>
                     Function Scope: When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function. Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.

                       <br>
                       <br>
                       JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.

                      <br>
                      <br>
                      1. When a function does not return anything it return undefined.
                      2. When value is not defined.
                      3. When you try to access a property of an object that does not exist.
